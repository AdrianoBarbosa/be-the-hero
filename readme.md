- Node.js, cross-env, Express (backend)
- SQLite, Knex (database)
- React, Axios (frontend)

# Cool, but... What is this?
Basically, the project connects NGOs with people who want to help.

The NGOs register the cases/incidents through the frontend and people visit the app, considering contacting the NGO via email or whatsapp to help, becoming the hero of this case.

## Backend
Structure with SQLite, RESTful API using Node.js.

## Frontend
React website where NGOs can signup and add cases that need help.
